## Team Contract (jinhohl2-junhong9-beomkic2-minwoo2)

### Communication 
1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 7-9 P.M. either using Zoom or meeting in person. We will be sharing our project codes, and we will take turns being the note taker/main screen. Whenever our team meets through Zoom, the main screen person will share his screen, and whenever our team meets in person, we will work on the main screen person's computer. All the notes will be shared on Google Document and the code will be saved in GitHub. 
2. **Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or phone. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to any type of contact within 24 hours. 
3. **Respect:** The note taker/main screen for the week will also serve as the 'project lead' for the weeky meeting. We will make sure that everyone's opinion is heard. Whenever the team has conflict, we will obey the rule of majority. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution:** Each week, we are expecting note taker/main screen person will do more work than other team members. However, we will not let the work amount between the note taker/main screen person and other team members' work be too much different. Also, we will make sure that non-note taker team members' work be evenly distributed. 
2. **Time Commitment:** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than five hours per week on the project. If someone asks for help, we will not hesistate to help and share work to make sure that each team member has even distribution. It is the team's responsibility, not the individual's responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 
However, if a team member is not contributing enough and cannot explain the fair situation, we will take further actions, such as alerting a staff member, based on the explanation. 
3. **Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts within the team will be decided by League of Legend Dr.Mundo dodge ball. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong.
